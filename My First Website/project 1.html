        <li>br tag Creates a <b>line break</b>.</li>     <!-- bold is used to put attention to particular word-->
        <li>div tag  Creates a <em>"box"</em> container element.</li>

        <h3>BLOCK</h3>
       </div>
       <P class="description">
         These tags creates a seperate paragraph or block.<br>
         ex- <b><em>hello udacity</em></b> is simply written and <b><em>hello my name is anku</em></b> is written inside paragraph tag<br><br>
         Output of the above will be:<b>"hello udacity"</b> in one line and <b>"hello my name is anku"</b> will be in the next line.
         in this way it creates a block around that particular sentence so that you can add more sentences as per the requirment.<br>

         <h3>TREE LIKE STRUCTURES:</h3>
       </div>
       <P class="description">
         The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on....<br>
         In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...<br>

        <h3>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDENTED HTML AND BOXES</h3>
      </div>
      <P class="description">
        When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.
      </P>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <div class="heading">
        <h3>TEXT EDITORS (for programming)</h3>
      </div>
      <P class="description">
        When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

         <h3>AVOIDING REPETITION</h3>
       </div>
       <P class="description">
         Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.<br>
         <b>Avoiding Errors:</b>When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.

         <h3>CSS</h3>
       </div>
       <P class="description">
         CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
